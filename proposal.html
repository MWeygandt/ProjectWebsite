    <h1>About</h1>
    <hr>
    <h3>What is the website about?</h3>
    <p>The website will be all about cheese. I, being lactose intollerant, live a hard life. I love cheese but my body doesn't. So instead of eating cheese I will create a website that lists many different types of cheese. There will also be plenty of info about the different types of cheese on their respective pages.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>What is the objective of your website?</h3>
    <p>To have fun making it! As well as creating a cheese database to educate people about cheese.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Who is your target audience?</h3>
    <p>Anyone who likes cheese and is curious about the different types.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>What content do you plan to include in each page of your website?</h3>
    <p>
        So besides the main homepage, sitemap, and contact page, my website will include:
        <ol>
            <li>Cheeses</li>
                <ul>This will be the focus of the content. I think I could create a separate liked page for each cheese type.</ul>
            <li>Common recepies</li>
                <ul>This page will have common food recepies that use common and uncommon types of cheese</ul>
            <li>Cheese stats</li>
                <ul>This page will hae fun stats like "how many pounds of cheese does the average American consume in a year." or like "this is how many cheeses come from a cow vs a goat."</ul>
            <li>How to make cheese</li>
                <ul>This page will have instructions on how to make some types of cheese so you can do it at home. I'll probably name this page "Do it from home!" or something similar.</ul>
        </ol>
    </p>
